## How the web works
*The web operates as a system where users access content through web browsers using URLs. The process begins with a browser sending a request, often over HTTP or HTTPS, to a specific web server identified by translating the URL's domain name into an IP address via the Domain Name System (DNS). The web server then responds by sending back the requested content, typically consisting of HTML (structure), CSS (style), and JavaScript (functionality) files. The browser renders these files into a visual and interactive web page for the user. Web pages are interconnected through hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate from one page to another easily. The entire ecosystem is underpinned by web standards to ensure compatibility across different browsers and devices, with security protocols like HTTPS ensuring data is transmitted securely.*

## HTTP
- *HTTP (The Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.*
- *HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access.*
- *HTTP functions as a request–response protocol in the client–server model.*
- *HTTP is designed to permit intermediate network elements to improve or enable communications between clients and servers.*
- *HTTP methods like GET and POST specify the desired action on the resource.*

## web servers
- *Web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP (the network protocol created to distribute web content) or its secure variant HTTPS.*
- *Web server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.*
- *Web server handles requests from clients (like web browsers), serving static content (e.g., HTML pages, images) directly or generating dynamic content by executing server-side scripts.*

## DNS
- *Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and distributed naming system for computers, services, and other resources in the Internet or other Internet Protocol (IP) networks.*
- *It associates various information with domain names (identification strings) assigned to each of the associated entities.*
