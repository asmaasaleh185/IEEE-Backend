## what is PHP?
- *A widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development.*
- *It is free to download and use.*
- *It is an interpreted language and it does not require a compiler.*
## what are the three main error types in PHP?
- *Parse error or Syntax Error: It is the type of error done by the programmer in the source code of the program.*
- *Warning Errors : The main reason of warning errors are including a missing file.*
- *Fatal Error: It is the type of error where PHP compiler understand the PHP code but it recognizes an undeclared function.*
## echo vs print
- *echo:*
>- *Can have multiple parameters.*
>- *Is slightly faster.*
>- *Returns no value or returns void.*
- *print:*
>- *Accepts only one argument at a time*.
>- *Returns the value 1, so can be used as an expression.*
>- *It is slower than an echo statement.*
## sensitivity in PHP
- *PHP is partially case-sensitive. Knowing what are case sensitive and what is not is very important to avoid syntax errors.*
## programming language vs scripting langauge
- *Programming Language*
 >Is a language which is used by humans to navigate their communication with computers. Programming Language is used to write computer programs. It is a high-speed language.
- *Scripting Language*
 >Is a language that uses a naive method to bring codes to a runtime environment. Scripting Language is used to create dynamic web applications. Scripting language contains different libraries.
## dynamically typed vs statically typed language
- *Statically Typed Languages*
 >Checking occurs at compile time. At compile time, source code in a specific programming language is converted to a machine-readable format. This means that before source code is compiled, the type associated with each and every single variable must be known.
- *Dynamically Typed Languages*
 >checking takes place at runtime or execution time. This means that variables are checked against types only when the program is executing.
## Assign by Value . VS . Assign by Reference
- *Assign by Value*
 >Making a copy of the original value and assigning it to a new variable. Any changes made to the new variable will not affect the original variable, and vice versa.
- *Assign by Reference*
 >Creating a reference or alias to the original variable. Any changes made to the new variable will be reflected in the original variable, and vice versa.
